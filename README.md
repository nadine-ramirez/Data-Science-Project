# Data-Science-Project
This project includes EDA, visualization using plotly and matplotlib, model training and hyperparameter tuning, data cleaning, and web scrapping.
It has seven sections:
1. Distinguish structured from unstructured data
2. Classify primary vs. secondary data
3. Manipulate public, API, and web-scraped data
4. Investigate observations by reading data from various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
5. Examine data quality by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
6. Identify distinguishing characteristics between clean data and unclean data
7. Identify and correct errors in data, such as typos, incorrect entries, or inconsistencies.
